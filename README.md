# HTML-CSS-Projects
These are the handful of assignments completed during my HTML and CSS courses with The Tech Academy

## Basic_HTML_and_CSS
This folder contains some of my very first html and css files. Nothing necessarily ground-breaking.

## Basic_HTML_and_Javascript_1
Again, this folder contains some of my first html files, but now with javascript!

## Bootstrap4_Project
Our first go at learning Bootstrap - this is a mockup website for a movie theatre where we incorporated different Bootstrap components.

## Final_Project
A simple one page website to demonstrate onhover effects, embedding a video with text overlay, and creating a table. I created the site in the theme of Avatar The Last Airbender.

## One-Page_Website
This assignment asked us to create a one page site with a home section, photo section, video section, and form section. I centered the site around a company - "Blanket Depot".

## Project
This was a step-by-step walk through with an instructor to illustrate how to target specific divs and ids within html and to also demonstrate how to successfully use onhover effects. This folder also contains Basic_CSS_demo_1 which contains some simple CSS animation effects.
